Task1

1.

2.
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple
of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed in a
comma-separated sequence on a single line.

code: 

''' Programmer name : katam Vamsi Krishna
    Mail : vamsikrishna.katamreddy@gmail.com'''

#method 1 not storing in any data structure

for i in range(2000,3201):
  if i % 7==0 and i % 5 !=0:
    print(i,end=",")
    
#method 2 storing in a list

numbers= []

for i in range(2000,3201):
  if i % 7==0 and i % 5 !=0:
    numbers.append(i)
else:
  print(numbers)
  
  
  
  
3.
Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in
the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.

code: 

firstName = input()
lastName = input()

print(firstName[::-1],"",lastName[::-1])



4.
Write a Python program to find the volume of a sphere with diameter 12 cm.
code:

diameter = 12
radius = diameter/2

volume = 4/3*math.pi*radius**3

print(volume)


Task 2:

1.
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
generate a list.

code: 

numbers = str(input("Enter some comma separated values: "))

li1 = numbers.split(",")

#print(li1)

li2 =[]
for i in li1:
  li2.append(int(i))
  
print(li2)


2.
Create the below pattern using nested for loop in Python.

code: 

for i in range(1,6):
  for j in range(1,i+1):
    print(" *",end="")
  else:
    print()

for i in range(4,0,-1):
  for j in range(i,0,-1):
    print(" *",end="")
  else:
    print()
    

3.
  Write a Python program to reverse a word after accepting the input from the user.
Sample Output:
Input word: AcadGild
Output: dilGdacA

code:

str1 = input("Enter some word: ")
str1 = str1[::-1]
print("reverse of word is :",str1)
